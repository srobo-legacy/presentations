                <!--
                Here are questions from last year:
                 - How do I cut MDF??
                 - How do I wire up a bump switch?
                 - Why doesn’t this servo work?
                 - How wide is the case of the servo board?
                 - What fuses are present in an SR kit?
                 - What is the resistance of the current limiting resistors on the Ruggeduino outputs?
                 - What are the signs that a LiPo is damaged ?
                 - This robot wants to turn a servo! (code is in the IDE: challenge-robot2 Team: SRZ)
                 - whops, this doesn’t compile (look at the code in challenge-code1, fix it… Team:SRZ)
                 - This robot wants to turn the motors! (code: challenge-robot3 team: SRZ)
                 - If two teams have the same number of tokens in the zone, which team owns the zone?
                 - What are the size and weight limits for robots?
                 - Can we use our own battery?
                 - Why does the yellow team have an advantage with their token positioning? (picture of arena)
                 - If we put a token in a slot, but someone takes it out before the end of the game, do we still get the point?
                 - Do I get a point for a token which is on my robot if my robot is in a zone?
                 - This robot wants to look and react! (code: challenge-robot4 team: SRZ robot drives and stops a motor if it sees a token)
